\## 1. Overview

LOPA (“the Service”) provides statistics-based champion recommendations for League of Legends. This policy explains what data we may collect and how we use it.



\## 2. Information We Collect

We do not require direct identifiers such as real name, phone number, or national ID.



\### (1) Operational logs

\- Data: timestamp, request path, status code, limited error info, IP address (server logs), user agent

\- Purpose: security, troubleshooting, quality improvement, abuse prevention

\- Retention: stored for a limited period and deleted as needed for operations



\### (2) Ads / analytics (if enabled)

We may display banner ads and/or use analytics tools.

\- Third-party providers may collect cookies or similar identifiers.

\- Purpose: ad delivery/measurement, usage analytics

\- You can manage cookies in your browser settings.



\### (3) User inputs

Manual inputs (bans/picks/role/champion pool) are used to compute recommendations.

By default, we do not store these inputs long-term. If we add sync/account features later, we will update this policy.



\### (4) Local Bridge (LCU integration)

A “Local Bridge” can read your local League Client (LCU) state on your PC.

\- The lockfile and LCU credentials stay on your PC.

\- The Service does not directly access your lockfile.

\- If you enable the bridge, current champ select state (bans/picks) may be reflected in the UI.

\- You can stop it anytime by closing the bridge.



\## 3. How We Use Data

\- Provide recommendations and statistics

\- Operate and secure the Service

\- Prevent abuse

\- (Optional) ads and analytics
